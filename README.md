a better bookmark system for SublimeText

Motivation
==========

Let's face it: sublime text's bookmark system __sucks__. It doesn't support named bookmarks. It doesn't save bookmark statuses, and it is just terrible to use overall.

Hence, This is a replacement for sublime text's bookmark functionality


Features
========

* Named bookmarks
* Bookmarks are saved across sessions
* Goto any bookmark in the project
* Add any number of bookmarks (not just 12).



To Use
======

###Adding Bookmarks###

Go to a line you wish to bookmark. Press ```ctrl + shift + P``` on Windows / Linux or ```cmd + shift + P``` on Mac and type ```Add Bookmark```. This opens up a panel where you can type the name of your bookmark. Once you're done naming your shiny new bookmark, hit ```Enter```. You should see a tiny yellow triangle next to your line. you're done!
