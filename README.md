a better bookmark system for SublimeText

![demo gif](https://mediacru.sh/isyhPHU37XOT#)

Motivation
==========

Let's face it: sublime text's bookmark system __sucks__. <rant> It doesn't support named bookmarks. It doesn't save bookmark statuses, and it is just terrible to use overall. </rant>

This is a replacement for sublime text's bookmark functionality. It's slicker and easier to use, and is persistent. 


Features
========

* Named bookmarks
* Bookmarks are saved across sessions
* Goto any bookmark in the project
* Add any number of bookmarks (not just 12).
